## [**iCEBreaker**](https://1bitsquared.de/products/icebreaker "‌")\*\* (€79.95)\*\*: an open-source, educational FPGA development board

![](https://1bitsquared.de/cdn/shop/files/icebreaker-v1_1a-iso-1_large.jpg?v=1736439243)

### HW Specifications:

- iCE40UP5K in QFN48 (SG48) package
  - [iCE40 UltraPlus 5K](http://www.latticesemi.com/-/media/LatticeSemi/Documents/DataSheets/iCE/iCE40-UltraPlus-Family-Data-Sheet.ashx "‌")
  - 5280 Logic Cells (4-LUT + Carry + FF)
  - 128 KBit Dual-Port Block RAM
  - 1 MBit (128 KB) Single-Port RAM
  - PLL, Two SPI and two I2C hard IPs
  - Two internal oscillators (10 kHz and 48 MHz)
  - 8 DSPs (16x16 multiply + 32 bit accumulate)
  - 3x 24mA drive and 3x hard PWM IP
- QSPI-DDR-capable flash 128 MBit (16 MB)
  - We selected to use the Winbond [W25Q128JVSIM](http://www.winbond.com/resource-files/w25q128jv_dtr%20revc%2003272018%20plus.pdf "‌")
  - We want to enable projects that access the flash and we want to provide the highest flash access speed possible.
- [FT2232H](http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/ICs/DS_FT2232H.pdf "‌") interface (microUSB plug)
  - Programming compatible with iCEstick and HX8K board
    - works with [Dimond Programmer](http://www.latticesemi.com/programmer "‌") and [iceprog](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/icestorm/tree/master/iceprog "‌")
  - serial port compatible with iCEstick and HX8K breakout board
  - 12 MHz XTAL oscillator (shared with FPGA)
  - Solder jumpers to offer direct SRAM programming (like on HX8K breakout board)
- 39 I/O capable pins:
  - 4 pins for config (SDI, SDO, SCK, CSB)
    - Either loading config from the onboard FLASH chip or provided through the FTDI chip with direct SRAM config.
  - 2 extra GPIO pins for QSPI
    - Together with the config pins, allows storage of additional data in the FLASH chip, and high speed QSPI DDR access. For example [picosoc](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32/tree/master/picosoc "‌") firmware.
  - 3 PINs for RGB LED (pin header)
  - 2 LEDs (one on output-only PLL pin)
  - 1 Clock pin (on PLL GBIN)
  - 1 UART Rx Pin via FTDI
  - 1 UART Tx Pin via FTDI
  - 1 Push Button
  - 16 PINs on dual PMOD
  - 8 PINs on single PMOD / snap-off section
- Support for FTDI Async FIFO mode
  - We want to support FTDI Async mode via some (unpopulated by default) zero-ohm resistors
  - This shares 8 GPIOs with the single PMOD / snap-off section
  - This would also enable the use of full list of RS232 signals
  - BDATA[0] -- Tx on FTDI / Rx on FPGA (always connected, no zohm resistor required)
  - BDATA[1] -- Rx on FTDI / Tx on FPGA (always connected, no zohm resistor required)
  - BDATA[7:2] -- Shared with snap-off section (via zohm resistor footprint)
  - RX Full -- Shared with snap-off section (via zohm resistor footprint)
  - TX Empty -- Shared with snap-off section (via zohm resistor footprint)
  - Read -- Shared with LED 1 (via zohm resistor footprint, LED used as RX indicator)
  - Write -- Shared with LED 2 (via zohm resistor footprint, LED used as TX indicator)
  - WakeUp -- Shared with Push Button (via zohm resistor footprint)
  - This configuration uses the following pins when the jumpers are reconfigured:
    - The two on-board red and green LED pins
    - The on-board user button pin
    - Snap off the section of single PMOD pins
- Snap-off section (convertible to PMOD host / PMOD device)
  - 5 LEDs in a similar arrangement to iCEstick
  - 3 Push Buttons
- Other stuff
  - Status LEDs for Power and CDONE (Configuration DONE)
  - Header with supply rails: 5V, 3V3, 1V2, GND
  - Debug header for all 6 QSPI pins
  - Test points for UART Rx / Tx signals
  - Jumpers or zohm resistors on all rails for measuring currents
  - Four 3mm mounting holes on the main section and two more on the snap-off section
  - The two LEDs on the main section should be wired "active low" so they work well as indicator LEDs for FIFO read/write.
  - The five LEDs on the snap-off section should be wired "active high"
  - A zohm resistor for Bank 2 supply, so that the IO voltage can be changed. Use Bank 2 for one of the ports on the double PMOD.
  - There should be auxiliary 5V pin headers available for the PMODs. Some PMODs need either a higher voltage or need to regulate their own voltage from 5V.
- Unpopulated parts shipped with the board
  - 3x Host PMOD (2x for dual PMOD port, 1x for snap-off section)
  - 1x Device PMOD (for other side of snap-off section)
